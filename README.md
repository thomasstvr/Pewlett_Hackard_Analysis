# Pewlett Hackard Silver Tsunami Analysis
Pewlett Hackard (PH) is a large tech company who employs thousands of people, many who are considered “Baby Boomers”. These Boomers are getting close to retirement which will leave PH with many empty positions that will need to be filled. PH is proactively assessing the situation to soften the blow caused by the so called “Silver Tsunami”. 

This analysis is aimed to help PH in their decision making by looking at the numbers. With this information, they now know just how many employees will be at retirement age, what department they work for and more.

## Results 
While trying to dig up some statistics to include in this ReadMe file, I came across something interesting. It appears the Challenge instructions are not accurate which has then led to a bad analysis. 

During the module, we took the time to build the “current_emp” table. This table contains all the current PH employees who were born between 1952 and 1955 and were hired between 1985 and 1988. The Challenge has us build our data on the “employees” table which contains many who are no longer employed with PH.

The challenge instructions fail to account for employees who are no longer with the company. This takes the soon to be retired from 133,776 to 72,458. This is a huge oversight as the sum of all employees in the “retiring_titles” table equals 90,398.
